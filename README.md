SM1Password Sync
================

SM1Password Sync is a third party application that allows you to sync your 1Password keychain with your iOS devices. The official 1Password USB syncing application can be found on their [website](http://blog.agilebits.com/tag/1password-usb-sync/).

*This is a third party project developed outside the auspices of AgileBits. Nothing here should imply their cooperation, association, or endorsement.*
